#Consideration #Stage/Backlog #Prioritised/False #UpdateFrequency/Unknown #OS/Unknown

Developers will pay a Levy on new residential buildings which
require building control approval, unless exempt to ensure
fairness and mitigate supply impacts. The Levy will raise funds to pay for remediation of cladding on buildings,
where a developer cannot be held responsible or identified, and is a key
element of ensuring industry pays.
